87|Nicosia 2013 Vulkà Bianco  (Etna)|Aromas include tropical fruit, broom, brimstone and dried herb.

87|Quinta dos Avidagos 2011 Avidagos Red (Douro)|This is ripe and fruity, a wine that is smooth while still structured. Firm tannins are filled out with juicy red berry fruits and freshened with acidity. It's  already drinkable, although it will certainly be better from 2016.|Roger Voss|@vossroger|15|Avidagos|Portuguese Red|||Douro|Portugal|Quinta dos Avidagos
87|Rainstorm 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)|Tart and snappy, the flavors of lime flesh and rind dominate. Some green pineapple pokes through, with crisp acidity underscoring the flavors.

87|Sweet Cheeks 2012 Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)|Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.|Paul Gregutt|@paulgwine |65|Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block|Pinot Noir|Willamette Valley|Willamette Valley|Oregon|US|Sweet Cheeks
87|Tandem 2011 Ars In Vitro Tempranillo-Merlot (Navarra)|Blackberry and raspberry aromas show a typical Navarran whiff of green herbs and, in this case, horseradish. In the mouth, this is fairly full bodied, with tomatoey acidity. Spicy, herbal flavors complement dark plum fruit, while the finish is fresh but grabby.|Michael Schachner|@wineschach|15|Ars In Vitro|Tempranillo-Merlot|Navarra||Northern Spain|Spain|Tandem
87|Terre di Giurfo 2013 Belsito Frappato (Vittoria)|Here's a bright, informal red that opens with aromas of candied berry, white pepper and savory herb that carry over to the palate.

Martini

87|Mirassou 2012 Chardonnay (Central Coast)|Building on 150 years and six generations of winemaking tradition, the winery trends toward a leaner style, with the classic California buttercream aroma cut by tart green apple. In this good everyday sipping wine, flavors that range from pear to barely ripe pineapple prove approachable but not distinctive.|Matt Kettmann|@mattkettmann|12||Chardonnay|Central Coast|Central Coast|California|US|Mirassou
87|Richard Böcking 2013 Devon Riesling (Mosel)|Zesty orange peels and apple notes abound in this sprightly, mineral-toned Riesling. Off dry on the palate, yet racy and lean, it's a refreshing, easy quaffer with wide appeal.|Anna Lee C. Iijima||24|Devon|Riesling|||Mosel|Germany|Richard Böcking
87|Felix Lavaque 2010 Felix Malbec (Cafayate)|Baked plum, molasses, balsamic vinegar and cheesy oak aromas feed into a palate that's braced by a bolt of acidity.

87|Gaucho Andino 2011 Winemaker Selection Malbec (Mendoza)|Raw black-cherry aromas are direct and simple but good.

87|Quiévremont 2012 Meritage (Virginia)|Red fruit aromas pervade on the nose, with cigar box and menthol notes riding in the back.

This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc is approachable now and ready to be enjoyed.|Alexander Peartree||32||Meritage|Virginia||Virginia|US|Quiévremont
87|Quiévremont 2012 Vin de Maison Red (Virginia)|Ripe aromas of dark berries mingle with ample notes of black pepper, toasted vanilla and dusty tobacco.

87|Acrobat 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon)|A sleek mix of tart berry, stem and herb, along with a hint of oak and chocolate, this is a fair value in a widely available, drink-now Oregon Pinot.

87|Bianchi 2011 Signature Selection Merlot (Paso Robles)|This wine from the Geneseo district offers aromas of sour plums and just enough cigar box to tempt the nose. The flavors are a bit flat at first, then the acidity and tension of sour cherries emerges in the midpalate, bolstered by some black licorice.|Matt Kettmann|@mattkettmann|22|Signature Selection|Merlot|Paso Robles|Central Coast|California|US|Bianchi
87|Canicattì 2009 Aynat Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)|Aromas of prune, blackcurrant, toast and oak carry through to the extracted palate, along with flavors of black cherry and roasted coffee beans.

86|Erath 2010 Hyland Pinot Noir (McMinnville)|As with many of the Erath 2010 vineyard designates, this is strongly herbal. The notes of leaf and herb create somewhat unripe flavor impressions, with a touch of bitterness on the finish. The fruit just passes the ripeness of sweet tomatoes.|Paul Gregutt|@paulgwine |50|Hyland|Pinot Noir|McMinnville|Willamette Valley|Oregon|US|Erath

86|Tarara 2010 #SocialSecret Red (Virginia)|Right out of the starting blocks this is an oaky wine, dripping with caramel and vanilla notes. The texture on the midpalate is finessed and graceful, with drying tannins that latch onto the oak-driven finish.

86|Tasca d'Almerita 2011 Sallier de la Tour Inzolia (Sicilia)|Spicy, fresh and clean, this would pair with fried seafood or spaghetti con vongole. It offers pretty citrus tones followed by a drying mineral nuance.|||13|Sallier de la Tour|Inzolia|Sicilia||Sicily & Sardinia|Italy|Tasca d'Almerita

85|Casa Silva 2008 Gran Reserva Petit Verdot (Colchagua Valley)|This is much different than Casa Silva's 2009 Petit Verdot, which was tasted in the same flight. The '08 is more hard, spicy and tarry, with a leafy, herbal aroma, plus some grittiness. The palate feels snappy, with a can't-miss saltiness. The finish is long in length but short on fruit, with a raw feel.|Michael Schachner|@wineschach|22|Gran Reserva|Petit Verdot|||Colchagua Valley|Chile|Casa Silva
85|Cantine di Dolianova 2010 Dolia  (Monica di Sardegna)|The Monica grape often shows a rustic or raw quality, with aromas of cherry cola, black pepper and sour fruit.

85|Tasca d'Almerita 2011 Sallier de la Tour Grillo (Sicilia)|There's a touch of toasted almond at the start, but then this Grillo revs up in the glass to deliver notes of citrus, stone fruit, crushed stone and lemon tart.

86|Podere dal Nespoli 2015 Prugneto Sangiovese (Romagna)|This densely hued wine has aromas of black plum and vanilla that carry over to the simple palate along with a touch of cedar.

86|Ram 2014 Alder Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))|The aromas are brooding, with notes of barrel spice and cherry.

86|Grifalco 2013 Daginestra  (Aglianico del Vulture)|Aromas of black-skinned fruit, leather, underbrush, game and a briny note all carry over to the lean, somewhat disjointed palate along with suggestions of licorice and raw red cherry.

Drink now.|Joe Czerwinski|@JoeCz|18|Made With Organic Grapes|Chardonnay|South Australia||South Australia|Australia|Yalumba
86|Z'IVO 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)|Some rosés are made simply by bleeding the juice from the fermenter, to concentrate the remaining wine.

86|Aresti 2014 Special Release Reserva Carmenère (Rapel Valley)|Caramelized oak and vanilla aromas are front and center on a barrel-heavy nose. This feels a bit choppy, with astringent tannins. Herbal salty plum flavors wear a lot of oaky makeup, while this finishes with a forced woody flavor.|Michael Schachner|@wineschach|12|Special Release Reserva|Carmenère|||Rapel Valley|Chile|Aresti
86|Spyro 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)|Bland, mature aromas of white fruits are on the weak side for Albariño. This feels round and oily, while briny leesy flavors lack pop and precision. A grabby aged finish is short on the free flow that this grape and region are known for.
